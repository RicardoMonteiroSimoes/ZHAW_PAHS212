# Applying hybrid solutions of classical and quantum computing to solve non trivial ML problems

This is the official repository for the project thesis of [Patrick Huber](https://github.com/22phuber) and [Ricardo Monteiro Simoes](https://github.com/RicardoMonteiroSimoes)

The goal of this project is to define problems non-trivial problems that can be solved using a multitude of ML-based algorithms, then compare them to an equivalent solution that is based on a hybrid algorithm. The hybrid algorithm is supposed to feature classical as well as quantum computing, so that it can combine the strong points of both variants.
